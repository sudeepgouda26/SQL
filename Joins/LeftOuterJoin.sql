ðŸ“„ Oracle SQL Interview Questions â€“ LEFT OUTER JOIN Focus
1.
List all departments and the names of employees working in them.
Include departments that have no employees.
  1  select d.dname,e.ename,d.deptno
  2  from dept d , emp e
  3* where d.deptno  = e.deptno(+)

2.
Write a query to display the department name and the total number of employees in each department.
Show departments with zero employees as well.
  1  select d.dname , count(empno)
note: 
 // why empno why not * beccuse count(*) also counts the null values that if any deprtment consists of null it give the count as 1 or 2 so carefully use the count
  2  from emp e , dept d
  3  where d.deptno = e.deptno(+)
  4* group by d.dname

7.
Explain the difference between an inner join and a left outer join using the EMP and DEPT tables.
Give example queries to support your answer./


1. Basic Left Outer Join:
Question: Write a query to retrieve all employee names and their corresponding department names, including employees who are not assigned to any department.

2. Right Outer Join:
Question: Write a query to list the department names and employee names for all departments, including departments that have no employees.

3. Left Outer Join for Employees without Departments:
Question: Write a query to find employees who are not assigned to any department, using a LEFT OUTER JOIN.

4. Difference Between Left and Right Outer Joins:
Question: What is the difference between a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN?

5. Left Outer Join with Salary Filtering:
Question: Write a query to find the department names and employee names for all departments, but only show employees whose salary is greater than 3000. Departments with no employees should still be shown.

6. Finding Departments with No Employees:
Question: Write a query to find departments that do not have any employees assigned to them, using a LEFT OUTER JOIN.

7. Combining Left and Right Outer Joins:
Question: What happens when you combine a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN in the same query?

8. Outer Join for Hierarchical Data:
Question: In an organization, each employee has a manager (who is also an employee). Write a query to find the employee names and their manager names, including employees with no managers (such as the CEO).

9. Multiple Left Joins on the Same Table:
Question: Write a query that lists employees, their departments, and their managers' departments using LEFT OUTER JOIN multiple times on the same table.

10. Left Outer Join with Aggregate Functions:
Question: Write a query to show the department names and the total salary of employees in each department. Show departments with no employees as well.

11. Finding Employees in the Same Department as a Specific Employee:
Question: Write a query to find all employees who work in the same department as 'KING', including employees with no department assigned.

12. Right Outer Join for Missing Data:
Question: Using a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, write a query to list all departments and the names of employees working in them. Include departments with no employees.

13. Employee Details and Manager Information:
Question: Using a LEFT OUTER JOIN, write a query to fetch employee names, their department names, and their managers' names.

14. Left Join for Including Null Values:
Question: Write a query to display employees who work in departments that have no employees, using a LEFT OUTER JOIN.

15. Using Left Outer Join to Detect Missing Information:
Question: Write a query to find departments where no employees are currently working, using LEFT OUTER JOIN and filtering appropriately.

These questions focus on testing knowledge and practical understanding of outer joins in SQL, including the LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
